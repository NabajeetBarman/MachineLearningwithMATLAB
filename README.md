# Machine Learning and Deep Learning basics with MATLAB

MATLAB provides very nice interface and functionality for basic Machine and Deep Learning tasks.

Live scripts and live functions are program files useful for interacting with a series of MATLABÂ® commands. Live scripts contain output and graphics with the code that produced them, together in a single interactive environment called the Live Editor. It is similar to Jupyter Notebooks!!!

This repository includes five live MATLAB scripts (.mlx) files demonstrating basic Machine and Deep learning concepts.

Hope this helps :)
